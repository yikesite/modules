# YikeSite Modules

Yikesite uses modules to extend the functionality of the websites that are being managed. There are two basic types of modules: Page Modules and Site Modules.

Page Modules allow end users to add functionality to a page, ie., making a page a blog, an FAQ, a calendar, etc. You can select which modules will be visible to clients. You can also select which modules are included with your Website Starter Templates. 

Site modules help with the coding of the site. These are done for convenience, and are not seen by end users. They are very helpful in making coding more efficient. Many of the modules are used in the YikeSite Template Sites.
